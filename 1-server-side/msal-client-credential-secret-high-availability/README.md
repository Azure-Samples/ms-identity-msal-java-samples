# MSAL Java sample demonstrating how a daemon console application can call Microsoft Graph using its own identity

## About this sample

### Overview

This app demonstrates how to use the [Microsoft identity platform](http://aka.ms/aadv2) to access the data of Microsoft business customers in a long-running, non-interactive process. It uses the [Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) for Java](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-java) to acquire an [access token](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens), which it then uses to call [Microsoft Graph](https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/overview) and accesses organizational data. The sample utilizes the [OAuth 2 client credentials grant](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow) and a secret value configured in Azure to obtain an access token for calls to Microsoft Graph.

This sample builds upon the [MSAL Java daemon sample](../msal-client-credential-secret) and adds the following feature:

- A custom token cache implementation that uses an in-memory cache with size eviction, based on [Google Guava cache](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/CachesExplained).

## Prerequisites

To use the sample, make sure that you have the following tools installed:

- [JDK Version 8](https://jdk.java.net/8/) (or later)
- [Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)

## Running the sample

Prior to running the sample, ensure that you've configured your application properties in `src/main/resources/application.properties`. The following are required:

| Property | Description |
|:---------|:------------|
| `TENANT_ID` | The unique GUID for your Microsoft Entra ID tenant. |
| `CLIENT_ID` | The unique GUID for your application, registered in your Microsoft Entra ID tenant. |
| `SECRET` | The secret configured for the client through the Azure Portal or via the Azure CLI. Make sure to use the client secret **value** and not the ID. |

>**Note**
>If you do not have an application registered, refer to [Quickstart: Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app).

To run the sample, navigate to the folder after cloning the repository:

```powershell
cd '.\1. Server-Side Scenarios\msal-client-credential-secret-high-availability\'
```

Build the project using Maven:

```powershell
mvn clean package
```

>**Note**
>If you are getting a "No compiler is provided in this environment. Perhaps you are running on a JRE rather than a JDK?", make sure that your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable points to the installed JDK and that you have installed the **Java Development Kit (JDK)** and not the Java Runtime Environment (JRE).

After the build is complete, navigate to the `target` folder and execute the sample with:

```powershell
java -jar  .\msal-client-credential-secret-1.0.0.jar
```
