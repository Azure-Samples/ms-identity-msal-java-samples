## Overview

This sample demonstrates a Java Spring Boot web app that uses the [Azure AD Spring Boot Starter client library for Java](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/tree/master/sdk/spring/azure-spring-boot-starter-active-directory) for authentication, authorization, and token acquisition with the [OpenID Connect](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-protocols-openid-connect-code) protocol to sign in users, and restricts access to pages based on Azure Active Directory security group membership.

![Overview](./ReadmeFiles/topology.png)

An Identity Developer session covered Azure AD App roles and security groups, featuring this scenario and how to handle the overage claim. [Watch the video Using Security Groups and Application Roles in your apps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRoc-na27l0)

## Scenario

1. This web application uses **Azure AD Spring Boot Starter client library for Java** to sign in users an Azure AD tenant and obtains an [ID Token](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/id-tokens) from **Azure AD**.
2. The **ID Token** contains the **groups** claim. The application loads these claims into Spring GrantedAuthorities list for the signed-in user. These values determine which pages the user is authorized to access.

## Prerequisites

- [JDK Version 15](https://jdk.java.net/15/). This sample has been developed on a system with Java 15 but may be compatible with other versions.
- [Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- [Java Extension Pack for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack) is recommended for running this sample in VSCode.
- An **Azure AD** tenant. For more information see: [How to get an Azure AD tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant)
- A user account in your **Azure AD** tenant. This sample will not work with a **personal Microsoft account**. Therefore, if you signed in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with a personal account and have never created a user account in your directory before, you need to do that now.
- Two security groups, named **AdminGroup** and **UserGroup**, containing the user(s) with whom you want to sign and test this sample. Or, you may add the user to two existing security groups in your tenant. If you choose to use existing groups, be sure to modify the sample configuration to use your existing security groups' name and object ID.

## Setup

### Clone or download this repository

From your shell or command line:

```console
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-java-spring-tutorial.git
    cd ms-identity-java-spring-tutorial
    cd 3-Authorization-II/groups
```

or download and extract the repository .zip file.

> :warning: To avoid path length limitations on Windows, we recommend cloning into a directory near the root of your drive.

### Register the sample application with your Azure Active Directory tenant

There is one project in this sample. To register it, you can:

- follow the steps below for manually register your apps
- or use PowerShell scripts that:
  - **automatically** creates the Azure AD applications and related objects (passwords, permissions, dependencies) for you.
  - modify the projects' configuration files.

<details>
  <summary>Expand this section if you want to use this automation:</summary>

> :warning: If you have never used **Azure AD Powershell** before, we recommend you go through the [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md) once to ensure that your environment is prepared correctly for this step.

1. On Windows, run PowerShell as **Administrator** and navigate to the root of the cloned directory
1. If you have never used Azure AD Powershell before, we recommend you go through the [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md) once to ensure that your environment is prepared correctly for this step.
1. In PowerShell run:

   ```PowerShell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process -Force
   ```

1. Run the script to create your Azure AD application and configure the code of the sample application accordingly.
1. In PowerShell run:

   ```PowerShell
   cd .\AppCreationScripts\
   .\Configure.ps1
   ```

   > Other ways of running the scripts are described in [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md)
   > The scripts also provide a guide to automated application registration, configuration and removal which can help in your CI/CD scenarios.

</details>

### Choose the Azure AD tenant where you want to create your applications

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. If your account is present in more than one Azure AD tenant, select your profile at the top right corner in the menu on top of the page, and then **switch directory** to change your portal session to the desired Azure AD tenant.

### Register the web app (java-spring-webapp-groups)

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the **Azure AD** service.
1. Select the **App Registrations** blade on the left, then select **New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application page** that appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `java-spring-webapp-groups`.
   - Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**.
   - In the **Redirect URI (optional)** section, select **Web** in the combo-box and enter the following redirect URI: `http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/`.
1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. In the app's registration screen, find and note the **Application (client) ID**. You use this value in your app's configuration file(s) later in your code.
1. Select **Save** to save your changes.
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **Certificates & secrets** blade in the left to open the page where you can generate secrets and upload certificates.
1. In the **Client secrets** section, select **New client secret**:
   - Type a key description (for instance `app secret`),
   - Select one of the available key durations (**6 months**, **12 months** or **Custom**) as per your security posture.
   - The generated key value will be displayed when you select the **Add** button. Copy and save the generated value for use in later steps.
   - You'll need this key later in your code's configuration files. This key value will not be displayed again, and is not retrievable by any other means, so make sure to note it from the Azure portal before navigating to any other screen or blade.
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **API permissions** blade in the left to open the page where we add access to the APIs that your application needs.
   - Select the **Add a permission** button and then,
   - Ensure that the **Microsoft APIs** tab is selected.
   - In the *Commonly used Microsoft APIs* section, select **Microsoft Graph**
   - In the **Delegated permissions** section, select the **GroupMember.Read.All** in the list. Use the search box if necessary. This permission is necessary for getting group memberships via Graph if the overage scenario occurs.
   - Click the button to grant admin consent for GroupMember.Read.All.
   - Select the **Add permissions** button at the bottom.

### Create Security Groups

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the **Azure AD** service.
1. Select **Groups** blade on the left.
1. In the **Groups** blade, select **New Group**.
    - For **Group Type**, select **Security**
    - For **Group Name**, enter **AdminGroup**
    - For **Group Description**, enter **Admin Security Group**
    - Add **Group Owners** and **Group Members** that you want to use and test in this sample.
    - Select **Create**.
1. In the **Groups** blade, select **New Group**.
    - For **Group Type**, select **Security**
    - For **Group Name**, enter **UserGroup**
    - For **Group Description**, enter **User Security Group**
    - Add **Group Owners** and **Group Members** that you want to use and test in this sample.
    - Select **Create**.

For more information, visit: [Create a basic group and add members using Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-groups-create-azure-portal)

### Configure Security Groups

You have two different options available to you on how you can further configure your application to receive the `groups` claim.

1. [Receive **all the groups** that the signed-in user is assigned to in an Azure AD tenant, included nested groups](#configure-your-application-to-receive-all-the-groups-the-signed-in-user-is-assigned-to-including-nested-groups).
2. [Receive the **groups** claim values from a **filtered set of groups** that your application is programmed to work with](#configure-your-application-to-receive-the-groups-claim-values-from-a-filtered-set-of-groups-a-user-may-be-assigned-to) (Not available in the [Azure AD Free edition](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/active-directory/)).

> To get the on-premise group's `samAccountName` or `On Premises Group Security Identifier` instead of Group ID, please refer to the document [Configure group claims for applications with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-fed-group-claims#prerequisites-for-using-group-attributes-synchronized-from-active-directory).

#### Configure your application to receive **all the groups** the signed-in user is assigned to, including nested groups

1. In the app's registration screen, select the **Token Configuration** blade in the left to open the page where you can configure the claims provided tokens issued to your application.
1. Select the **Add groups claim** button on top to open the **Edit Groups Claim** screen.
1. Select `Security groups` **or** the `All groups (includes distribution lists but not groups assigned to the application)` option. Choosing both negates the effect of `Security Groups` option.
1. Under the **ID** section, select `Group ID`. This will result in Azure AD sending the [object id](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/api/resources/group?view=graph-rest-1.0) of the groups the user is assigned to in the **groups** claim of the [ID Token](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/id-tokens) that your app receives after signing-in a user.

#### Configure your application to receive the `groups` claim values from a **filtered set of groups** a user may be assigned to

##### Prerequisites, benefits and limitations of using this option

1. This option is useful when your application is interested in a selected set of groups that a signing-in user may be assigned to and not every security group this user is assigned to in the tenant.  This option also saves your application from running into the [overage](#groups-overage-claim) issue.
1. This feature is not available in the [Azure AD Free edition](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/active-directory/).
1. **Nested group assignments** are not available when this option is utilized.

##### Steps to enable this option in your app

1. In the app's registration screen, select the **Token Configuration** blade in the left to open the page where you can configure the claims provided tokens issued to your application.
1. Select the **Add groups claim** button on top to open the **Edit Groups Claim** screen.
1. Select `Groups assigned to the application`.
    1. Choosing additional options like `Security Groups` or `All groups (includes distribution lists but not groups assigned to the application)` will negate the benefits your app derives from choosing to use this option.
1. Under the **ID** section, select `Group ID`. This will result in Azure AD sending the object [id](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/api/resources/group?view=graph-rest-1.0) of the groups the user is assigned to in the `groups` claim of the [ID Token](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/id-tokens) that your app receives after signing-in a user.
1. If you are exposing a Web API using the **Expose an API** option, then you can also choose the `Group ID` option under the **Access** section. This will result in Azure AD sending the [Object ID](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/api/resources/group?view=graph-rest-1.0) of the groups the user is assigned to in the `groups` claim of the [Access Token](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens) issued to the client applications of your API.
1. In the app's registration screen, select on the **Overview** blade in the left to open the Application overview screen. Select the hyperlink with the name of your application in **Managed application in local directory** (note this field title can be truncated for instance `Managed application in ...`). When you select this link you will navigate to the **Enterprise Application Overview** page associated with the service principal for your application in the tenant where you created it. You can navigate back to the app registration page by using the *back* button of your browser.
1. Select the **Users and groups** blade in the left to open the page where you can assign users and groups to your application.
    1. Select the **Add user** button on the top row.
    1. Select **User and Groups** from the resultant screen.
    1. Choose the groups that you want to assign to this application.
    1. Click **Select** in the bottom to finish selecting the groups.
    1. Select **Assign** to finish the group assignment process.  
    1. Your application will now receive these selected groups in the `groups` claim when a user signing in to your app is a member of  one or more these **assigned** groups.
1. Select the **Properties** blade in the left to open the page that lists the basic properties of your application.Set the **User assignment required?** flag to **Yes**.

> :bulb: **Important security tip**
>
> When you set **User assignment required?** to **Yes**, Azure AD will check that only users assigned to your application in the **Users and groups** blade are able to sign-in to your app. You can assign users directly or by assigning security groups they belong to.

### Configure your code sample to use your app registration and security groups (java-spring-webapp-groups)

Open the project in your IDE (like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code) to configure the code.

> In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

Open the `src\main\resources\application.yml` file.
  
1. Find the key `Enter_Your_Tenant_ID_Here` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant ID.
2. Find the key `Enter_Your_Client_ID_Here` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of `java-spring-webapp-groups` app copied from the Azure portal.
3. Find the key `Enter_Your_Client_Secret_Here` and replace the existing value with the key you saved during the creation of `java-spring-webapp-groups` copied from the Azure portal.
4. Find the key `Enter_Your_Admin_Group_ID_Here` and replace the existing value with objectId of your **AdminGroup**.
5. Find the key `Enter_Your_User_Group_ID_Here` and replace the existing value with the objectId of your **UserGroup**

Open the `src/main/java/com/microsoft/azuresamples/msal4j/msidentityspringbootwebapp/SampleController.java` file.

1. Find the key `Enter_Your_Admin_Group_ID_Here` and replace the existing value with objectId of your **AdminGroup**.
2. Find the key `Enter_Your_User_Group_ID_Here` and replace the existing value with the objectId of your **UserGroup**

![Experience](./ReadmeFiles/app.png)

## Explore the sample

- Note the signed-in or signed-out status displayed at the center of the screen.
- Click the context-sensitive button at the top right (it will read `Sign In` on first run)
- Alternatively, click the link to `token details`, `admins only` or `regular users`. Since these are protected pages that require authentication, you'll be automatically redirected to the sign-in page.
- Follow the instructions on the next page to sign in with an account in the Azure AD tenant.
- On the consent screen, note the scopes that are being requested.
- Upon successful completion of the sign-in flow, you should be redirected to the home page (`sign in status`), or one of the other pages, depending on which button triggered your sign-in flow.
- Note the context-sensitive button now says `Sign out` and displays your username to its left.
- If you are on the home page, you'll see an option to click **ID Token Details**: click it to see some of the ID token's decoded claims, including **groups**.
- Click the **Admins Only** button to view the `/admin_only`. Only users belonging to the **AdminGroup** security group will be able to view this page. Otherwise an authorization failure message will be displayed.
- Click the **Regular Users** button to view the `/regular_user` page. Only users belonging to the **UserGroup** security group will be able to view this page. Otherwise an authorization failure message will be displayed.
- You can also use the button on the top right to sign out. The status page will reflect this.

## About the code


This sample demonstrates how to use [Azure AD Spring Boot Starter client library for Java](https://docs.microsoft.com/java/api/overview/azure/active-directory-spring-boot-starter-readme?view=azure-java-stable) to sign in users into your Azure AD tenant. It also makes use of **Spring Oauth2 Client** and **Spring Web** boot starters. It uses claims from **ID Token** obtained from Azure Active Directory to display details of the signed-in user, and to restrict access to some pages by using the groups claim for authorization.

### Project Initialization

Create a new Java Maven project and copy the `pom.xml` file from this project, and the `src` folder of this repository.

If you'd like to create a project like this from scratch, you may use [Spring Initializer](https://start.spring.io):

- For **Packaging**, select `Jar`
- For **Java** select version `11`
- For **Dependencies**, add the following:
  - Azure Active Directory
  - Spring Oauth2 Client
  - Spring Web
- Be sure that it comes with Azure SDK version 3.5 or higher. If not, please consider replacing the pre-configured `pom.xml` with the `pom.xml` from this repository.

### ID Token Claims

To extract token details, make use of Spring Security's `AuthenticationPrincipal` and `OidcUser` object in a request mapping. See the [Sample Controller](./src/main/java/com/microsoft/azuresamples/msal4j/msidentityspringbootwebapp/SampleController.java) for an example of this app making use of ID Token claims.

```java
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.core.oidc.user.OidcUser;
import org.springframework.security.core.annotation.AuthenticationPrincipal;
//...
@GetMapping(path = "/some_path")
public String tokenDetails(@AuthenticationPrincipal OidcUser principal) {
    Map<String, Object> claims = principal.getIdToken().getClaims();
}
```

### Processing Groups claim in the ID token

The name of the the roles that the signed-in user is assigned to is returned in the `groups` claim of the token.

```JSON
{
  ...
  "groups": [
    "xyz-id-xyz",
    "xyz-id-xyz",]
  ...
}
```

A common way to access them is documented in the **ID Token Claims** section above.
Azure AD Boot Starter (v3.5 and above) parses the groups claim automatically and adds each group to the signed in user's **Authorities**. This allows developers to make use of groups with Spring **PrePost** condition annotations using the `hasAuthority` method. For example, you'll find the following `@PreAuthorize` conditions demonstrated in `SampleController.java`:

```java
@GetMapping(path = "/admin_only")
@PreAuthorize("hasAuthority('enter-admin-group-id-here')")
public String adminOnly(Model model) {
    // restrict to users who belong to AdminGroup
}
@GetMapping(path = "/regular_user")
@PreAuthorize("hasAnyAuthority('enter-user-group-id-here','enter-admin-group-id-here')")
public String regularUser(Model model) {
    // restrict to users who belong to any of UserGroup or AdminGroup
}
```

To see a full list of authorities for a given user:

 ```java
@GetMapping(path = "/some_path")
public String tokenDetails(@AuthenticationPrincipal OidcUser principal) {
    Collection<? extends GrantedAuthority> authorities = principal.getAuthorities();
}
```

### Sign-in and sign-out links

To sign in, you must make a request to the Azure Active Directory sign-in endpoint that is automatically configured by **Azure AD Spring Boot Starter client library for Java**.

```html
<a class="btn btn-success" href="/oauth2/authorization/azure">Sign In</a>
```

To sign out, you must make POST request to the **logout** endpoint.

```HTML
<form action="#" th:action="@{/logout}" method="post">
  <input class="btn btn-warning" type="submit" value="Sign Out" />
</form>
```

### Authentication-dependent UI elements

This app has some simple logic in the UI template pages for determining content to display based on whether the user is authenticated or not. For example, the following Spring Security Thymeleaf tags may be used:

```html
<div sec:authorize="isAuthenticated()">
  this content only shows to authenticated users
</div>
<div sec:authorize="isAnonymous()">
  this content only shows to not-authenticated users
</div>
```

### Protecting routes with AADWebSecurityConfigurerAdapter

By default, this app protects the **ID Token Details**, **Admins Only** and **Regular Users** pages so that only logged-in users can access them. This app uses configures these routes from the `app.protect.authenticated` property from the `application.yml` file. To configure your app's specific requirements, extend `AADWebSecurityConfigurationAdapter` in one of your classes. For an example, see this app's [SecurityConfig](./src/main/java/com/microsoft/azuresamples/msal4j/msidentityspringbootwebapp/SecurityConfig.java) class.

```java
@EnableWebSecurity
@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity(prePostEnabled = true)
public class SecurityConfig extends AADWebSecurityConfigurerAdapter{
  @Value( "${app.protect.authenticated}" )
  private String[] protectedRoutes;

    @Override
    public void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    // use required configuration form AADWebSecurityAdapter.configure:
    super.configure(http);
    // add custom configuration:
    http.authorizeRequests()
      .antMatchers(protectedRoutes).authenticated()     // limit these pages to authenticated users (default: /token_details, /admin_only, /regular_user)
      .antMatchers("/**").permitAll();                  // allow all other routes.
    }
}
```

### The Groups Overage Claim

To ensure that the token size doesn’t exceed HTTP header size limits, the Microsoft Identity Platform limits the number of object Ids that it includes in the **groups** claim.

If a user is member of more groups than the overage limit (**150 for SAML tokens, 200 for JWT tokens, 6 for single-page applications**), then the Microsoft identity platform does not emit the group IDs in the `groups` claim in the token. Instead, it includes an **overage** claim in the token that indicates to the application to query the [MS Graph API](https://graph.microsoft.com) to retrieve the user’s group membership.

Azure AD Boot Starter (v3.5 and above) parses the groups claim automatically and adds each group to the signed in user's **Authorities**. It **automatically** handles the groups overage scenario.

> We strongly advise you use the [group filtering feature](#configure-your-application-to-receive-the-groups-claim-values-from-a-filtered-set-of-groups-a-user-may-be-assigned-to) (if possible) to avoid running into group overages.

#### Create the Overage Scenario for testing

1. You can use the `BulkCreateGroups.ps1` provided in the [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/) folder to create a large number of groups and assign users to them. This will help test overage scenarios during development. Remember to change the user's **objectId** provided in the `BulkCreateGroups.ps1` script.

When attending to overage scenarios, which requires a call to [Microsoft Graph](https://graph.microsoft.com) to read the signed-in user's group memberships, your app will need to have the [User.Read](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/permissions-reference#user-permissions) and [GroupMember.Read.All](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/permissions-reference#group-permissions) for the [getMemberGroups](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/api/user-getmembergroups) function to execute successfully.

> :warning: For the overage scenario, make sure you have granted **Admin Consent** for the MS Graph API's **GroupMember.Read.All** scope for both the Client and the Service apps (see the **App Registration** steps above).

### Deploying web app to Azure App Services

There is one web app in this sample. To deploy it to **Azure App Services**, you'll need to:

- create an **Azure App Service**
- publish the projects to the **App Services**, and
- update its client(s) to call the website instead of the local environment.

#### Update the Azure AD app registration (java-spring-webapp-groups)

1. Navigate back to to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
In the left-hand navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service, and then select **App registrations (Preview)**.
1. In the resulting screen, select the `java-spring-webapp-groups` application.
1. In the app's registration screen, select **Authentication** in the menu.
   - In the **Redirect URIs** section, update the reply URLs to match the site URL of your Azure deployment. For example:
      - `https://java-spring-webapp-groups.azurewebsites.net/login/oauth2/code/`

> :warning: If your app is using an *in-memory* storage, **Azure App Services** will spin down your web site if it is inactive, and any records that your app was keeping will emptied. In addition, if you increase the instance count of your website, requests will be distributed among the instances. Your app's records, therefore, will not be the same on each instance.
