## Overview

This sample demonstrates how to create a Java Servlet web app that signs in users with [Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) for Java](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-java) and restricts access to pages based on Azure Active Directory security group membership.

![Overview](./ReadmeFiles/topology.png)

An Identity Developer session covered Azure AD App roles and security groups, featuring this scenario and how to handle the overage claim. [Watch the video Using Security Groups and Application Roles in your apps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRoc-na27l0)

## Scenario

1. This web application uses **MSAL for Java (MSAL4J)** to sign in users an Azure AD tenant and obtains an [ID Token](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/id-tokens) from **Azure AD**.
2. The **ID Token** proves that a user has successfully authenticated with this tenant.
3. The web application protects its routes according to user's authentication status and group membership.

## Prerequisites

- [JDK Version 8 or higher](https://jdk.java.net/8/)
- [Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- An Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. For more information on how to get an Azure AD tenant, see [How to get an Azure AD tenant](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-howto-tenant/)
- A user account in your own Azure AD tenant.
- Two security groups, **GroupAdmin** and **GroupMember**, containing users you want to test with.

## Setup

### Clone or download this repository

From your shell or command line:

```console
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-java-servlet-webapp-authentication.git
cd 3-Authorization-II/groups
```

or download and extract the repository .zip file.

> :warning: To avoid file path length limitations on Windows, clone the repository into a directory near the root of your hard drive.

## Register the sample application with your Azure Active Directory tenant

There is one project in this sample. To register the app on the portal, you can:

- either follow manual configuration steps below
- or use PowerShell scripts that:
  - **automatically** creates the Azure AD applications and related objects (passwords, permissions, dependencies) for you.
  - modify the projects' configuration files.
  - by default, the automation scripts set up an application that works with **accounts in your organizational directory only**.

<details>
  <summary>Expand this section if you want to use PowerShell automation.</summary>

1. On Windows, run PowerShell and navigate to the root of the cloned directory
1. In PowerShell run:

   ```PowerShell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process -Force
   ```

1. Run the script to create your Azure AD application and configure the code of the sample application accordingly.
1. In PowerShell run:

   ```PowerShell
   cd .\AppCreationScripts\
   .\Configure.ps1
   ```

   > Other ways of running the scripts are described in [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md)
   > The scripts also provide a guide to automated application registration, configuration and removal which can help in your CI/CD scenarios.

</details>

### Choose the Azure AD tenant where you want to create your applications

As a first step you'll need to:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. If your account is present in more than one Azure AD tenant, select your profile at the top right corner in the menu on top of the page, and then **switch directory** to change your portal session to the desired Azure AD tenant.

### Register the web app (java-servlet-webapp-groups)

[Register a new web app](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app) in the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).
Following this guide, you must:

1. Navigate to the Microsoft identity platform for developers [App registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) page.
1. Select **New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application page** that appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `java-servlet-webapp-groups`.
   - Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**.
   - In the **Redirect URI** section, select **Web** in the combo-box and enter the following redirect URI: `http://localhost:8080/msal4j-servlet-groups/auth/redirect`.
1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. In the app's registration screen, find and note the **Application (client) ID**. You use this value in your app's configuration file(s) later in your code.
1. Select **Save** to save your changes.
1. In the app's registration screen, click on the **Certificates & secrets** blade in the left to open the page where we can generate secrets and upload certificates.
1. In the **Client secrets** section, click on **New client secret**:
   - Type a key description (for instance `app secret`),
   - Select one of the available key durations (**In 1 year**, **In 2 years**, or **Never Expires**) as per your security concerns.
   - The generated key value will be displayed when you click the **Add** button. Copy the generated value for use in the steps later.
   - You'll need this key later in your code's configuration files. This key value will not be displayed again, and is not retrievable by any other means, so make sure to note it from the Azure portal before navigating to any other screen or blade.
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **API permissions** blade in the left to open the page where we add access to the APIs that your application needs.
   - Select the **Add a permission** button and then:
   - Ensure that the **Microsoft APIs** tab is selected.
       - In the *Commonly used Microsoft APIs* section, select **Microsoft Graph**
       - In the **Delegated permissions** section, select **User.Read** and **GroupMember.Read.All** in the list. Use the search box if necessary.
       - Select the **Add permissions** button at the bottom.
   - **GroupMember.Read.All** requires admin consent. Select the **Grant/revoke admin consent for {tenant}** button, and then select **Yes** when you are asked if you want to grant consent for the requested permissions for all accounts in the tenant. You need to be an Azure AD tenant admin to do this.

#### Configure the web app (java-servlet-webapp-groups) to use your app registration

Open the project in your IDE to configure the code.

> In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId". Remove the curly braces from the placeholder values as well.

1. Open the `./src/main/resources/authentication.properties` file
2. Find the string `{enter-your-tenant-id-here}`. Replace the existing value with:
    - **Your Azure AD tenant ID** if you registered your app with the **Accounts in this organizational directory only** option.
3. Find the string `{enter-your-client-id-here}` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of the `java-servlet-webapp-groups` application copied from the Azure portal.
4. Find the string `{enter-your-client-secret-here}` and replace the existing value with the key you saved during the creation of the `java-servlet-webapp-groups` app, in the Azure portal.

### Configure Security Groups

You have two different options available to you on how you can further configure your application(s) to receive the `groups` claim.

1. [Receive **all the groups** that the signed-in user is assigned to in an Azure AD tenant, including nested groups](#configure-your-application-to-receive-all-the-groups-the-signed-in-user-is-assigned-to-including-nested-groups).
2. [Receive the **groups** claim values from a **filtered set of groups** that your application is programmed to work with](#configure-your-application-to-receive-the-groups-claim-values-from-a-filtered-set-of-groups-a-user-may-be-assigned-to) (Not available in the [Azure AD Free edition](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/active-directory/)).

> To get the on-premise group's `samAccountName` or `On Premises Group Security Identifier` instead of Group ID, please refer to the document [Configure group claims for applications with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-fed-group-claims#prerequisites-for-using-group-attributes-synchronized-from-active-directory).

#### Configure your application to receive **all the groups** the signed-in user is assigned to, including nested groups

1. In the app's registration screen, select the **Token Configuration** blade in the left to open the page where you can configure the claims provided tokens issued to your application.
1. Select the **Add groups claim** button on top to open the **Edit Groups Claim** screen.
1. Select `Security groups` **or** the `All groups (includes distribution lists but not groups assigned to the application)` option. Choosing both negates the effect of `Security Groups` option.
1. Under the **ID** section, select `Group ID`. This will result in Azure AD sending the [Object ID](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/api/resources/group?view=graph-rest-1.0) of the groups the user is assigned to in the **groups** claim of the [ID Token](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/id-tokens) that your app receives after signing-in a user.

#### Configure your application to receive the `groups` claim values from a **filtered set of groups** a user may be assigned to

##### Prerequisites, benefits and limitations of using this option

1. This option is useful when your application is interested in a selected set of groups that a signing-in user may be assigned to and not every security group this user is assigned to in the tenant. This option also saves your application from running into the [overage](#the-groups-overage-claim) issue.
1. This feature is not available in the [Azure AD Free edition](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/active-directory/).
1. **Nested group assignments** are not available when this option is utilized.

##### Steps to enable this option in your app

1. In the app's registration screen, select the **Token Configuration** blade in the left to open the page where you can configure the claims provided tokens issued to your application.
1. Select the **Add groups claim** button on top to open the **Edit Groups Claim** screen.
1. Select `Groups assigned to the application`.
    1. Choosing additional options like `Security Groups` or `All groups (includes distribution lists but not groups assigned to the application)` will negate the benefits your app derives from choosing to use this option.
1. Under the **ID** section, select `Group ID`. This will result in Azure AD sending the [Object ID](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/api/resources/group?view=graph-rest-1.0) of the groups the user is assigned to in the `groups` claim of the [ID Token](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/id-tokens).
1. If you are exposing a web API using the **Expose an API** option, then you can also choose the `Group ID` option under the **Access** section. This will result in Azure AD sending the [Object ID](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/api/resources/group?view=graph-rest-1.0) of the groups the user is assigned to in the `groups` claim of the [Access Token](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens).
1. In the app's registration screen, select on the **Overview** blade in the left to open the Application overview screen. Select the hyperlink with the name of your application in **Managed application in local directory** (note this field title can be truncated for instance `Managed application in ...`). When you select this link you will navigate to the **Enterprise Application Overview** page associated with the service principal for your application in the tenant where you created it. You can navigate back to the app registration page by using the *back* button of your browser.
1. Select the **Users and groups** blade in the left to open the page where you can assign users and groups to your application.
    1. Select the **Add user** button on the top row.
    1. Select **User and Groups** from the resultant screen.
    1. Choose the groups that you want to assign to this application.
    1. Click **Select** in the bottom to finish selecting the groups.
    1. Select **Assign** to finish the group assignment process.  
    1. Your application will now receive these selected groups in the `groups` claim when a user signing in to your app is a member of  one or more these **assigned** groups.
1. Select the **Properties** blade in the left to open the page that lists the basic properties of your application.Set the **User assignment required?** flag to **Yes**.

> :bulb: **Important security tip**
>
> When you set **User assignment required?** to **Yes**, Azure AD will check that only users assigned to your application in the **Users and groups** blade are able to sign-in to your app. You can assign users directly or by assigning security groups they belong to.

### Configure the web app (java-servlet-webapp-groups) to recognize Group IDs

> :warning:
> During **Token Configuration**, if you have chosen any other option except **groupID** (e.g. like **DNSDomain\sAMAccountName**) you should enter the **group name** (for example `contoso.com\Test Group`) instead of the **object ID** below:

1. Open the `./src/main/resources/authentication.properties` file.
2. Find the string `{enter-your-admins-group-id-here}` and replace the existing value with the **object ID** of the **GroupAdmin** group copied from the Azure portal. Remove the curly braces from the placeholder value as well.
3. Find the string `{enter-your-users-group-id-here}` and replace the existing value with the **object ID** of the **GroupMember** group copied from the Azure portal. Remove the curly braces from the placeholder value as well.

## Running The Sample
#### Build .war File Using Maven

1. Navigate to the directory containing the pom.xml file for this sample (the same directory as this README), and run the following Maven command:
    ```
    mvn clean package
    ```
1. This should generate a `.war` file which can be run on a variety of application servers

#### Deploying the Sample

Our samples can be deployed to a number of application servers, such as Tomcat, WebLogic, or Webshpere, and MSAL Java itself can generally be integrated into existing applications without changes to your existing deployment set up.

You can find instructions for deploying our samples [here on MSAL Java's Github wiki](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-java/wiki/Deployment-Instructions-for-MSAL-Java-Samples).

![Experience](./ReadmeFiles/app.png)

## Explore the sample

- Note the signed-in or signed-out status displayed at the center of the screen.
- Click the context-sensitive button at the top right (it will read `Sign In` on first run)
- Follow the instructions on the next page to sign in with an account in the Azure AD tenant.
- On the consent screen, note the scopes that are being requested.
- Note the context-sensitive button now says `Sign out` and displays your username to its left.
- The middle of the screen now has an option to click for **ID Token Details**: click it to see some of the ID token's decoded claims.
- Click the **Groups** button to see any information about security group membership for the signed in user.
- Click the **Admin Only** or **Regular User** buttons to access the groups claim protected endpoints.
  - If your signed in user is in the GroupAdmin group, the user will be able to enter both pages.
  - If your signed in user is in the GroupMember group, the user will be able to enter the Regular User page only.
  - If your signed in user is in neither group, the user will be able to access to none of the two pages.
- You can also use the button on the top right to sign out.
- After signing out, click the link to `ID Token Details` to observe that the app displays a `401: unauthorized` error instead of the ID token claims when the user is not authorized.

## Processing Groups claim in tokens, including handling **overage**

### The `groups` claim

The object id of the security groups the signed in user is member of is returned in the `groups` claim of the token.

```JSON
{
  ...
  "groups": [
    "0bbe91cc-b69e-414d-85a6-a043d6752215",
    "48931dac-3736-45e7-83e8-015e6dfd6f7c",]
  ...
}
```

### The groups overage claim

To ensure that the token size doesn’t exceed HTTP header size limits, the Microsoft Identity Platform limits the number of object Ids that it includes in the **groups** claim.

If a user is member of more groups than the overage limit (**150 for SAML tokens, 200 for JWT tokens, 6 for Single Page applications**), then the Microsoft Identity Platform does not emit the group IDs in the `groups` claim in the token. Instead, it includes an **overage** claim in the token that indicates to the application to query the [MS Graph API](https://graph.microsoft.com) to retrieve the user’s group membership.

```JSON
{
  ...
  "_claim_names": {
    "groups": "src1"
    },
    {
   "_claim_sources": {
    "src1": {
        "endpoint":"[Graph Url to get this user's group membership from]"
        }
    }
  ...
}
```

#### Create the overage scenario in this sample for testing

1. You can use the `BulkCreateGroups.ps1` provided in the [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/) folder to create a large number of groups and assign users to them. This will help test overage scenarios during development. Remember to change the user's **objectId** provided in the `BulkCreateGroups.ps1` script.
1. When you run this sample and an overage occurred, then you'd see the  `_claim_names` in the home page after the user signs-in.
1. We strongly advise you use the [group filtering feature](#configure-your-application-to-receive-the-groups-claim-values-from-a-filtered-set-of-groups-a-user-may-be-assigned-to) (if possible) to avoid running into group overages.
1. In case you cannot avoid running into group overage, we suggest you use the following logic to process groups claim in your token.  
    1. Check for the claim `_claim_names` with one of the values being `groups`. This indicates overage.
    1. If found, make a call to the endpoint specified in `_claim_sources` to fetch user’s groups.
    1. If none found, look into the `groups`  claim for user’s groups.

> When attending to overage scenarios, which requires a call to [Microsoft Graph](https://graph.microsoft.com) to read the signed-in user's group memberships, your app will need to have the [GroupMember.Read.All](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/permissions-reference#group-permissions) for the [getMemberObjects](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/api/user-getmemberobjects?view=graph-rest-1.0) function to execute successfully.

> Developers who wish to gain good familiarity of programming for Microsoft Graph are advised to go through the [An introduction to Microsoft Graph for developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBbnpFdB92A) recorded session.

## We'd love your feedback!

Were we successful in addressing your learning objective? Consider taking a moment to [share your experience with us](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR73pcsbpbxNJuZCMKN0lURpURDQwVUxQWENUMlpLUlA0QzdJNVE3TUJRSyQlQCN0PWcu).

## About the code

This sample uses **MSAL for Java (MSAL4J)** to sign a user in and obtain an ID token that may contain the groups claim. If there are too many groups for emission in the ID token, the sample leverages [Microsoft Graph SDK for Java](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-java) to obtain the group membership data from Microsoft Graph. Based on the groups the user belongs to, the signed in user will be able to access either none, one, or both of the protected pages, `Admins Only` and `Regular Users`.

If you want to replicate this sample's behavior, you must add these libraries (MSAL4J and MS Graph SDK) your projects using Maven. As a developer, you may choose to copy the `pom.xml` file, and the contents of the `helpers` and `authservlets` packages in the `src/main/java/com/microsoft/azuresamples/msal4j` package. You'll also need the [authentication.properties file](src/main/resources/authentication.properties). These classes and files contain generic code that can be used in a wide array of applications. The rest of the sample may be copied as well, but the other classes and files are built specifically to address this sample's objective.

A **ConfidentialClientApplication** instance is created in the [AuthHelper.java](src/main/java/com/microsoft/azuresamples/authentication/AuthHelper.java) class. This object helps craft the AAD authorization URL and also helps exchange the authentication token for an access token.

```Java
// getConfidentialClientInstance method
IClientSecret secret = ClientCredentialFactory.createFromSecret(SECRET);
confClientInstance = ConfidentialClientApplication
                    .builder(CLIENT_ID, secret)
                    .authority(AUTHORITY)
                    .build();
```

The following parameters need to be provided upon instantiation:

- The **Client ID** of the app
- The **Client Secret**, which is a requirement for Confidential Client Applications
- The **Azure AD Authority**, which includes your AAD tenant ID.

In this sample, these values are read from the [authentication.properties](src/main/resources/authentication.properties) file using a properties reader in the class [Config.java](src/main/java/com/microsoft/azuresamples/authentication/Config.java).

### Step-by-step walkthrough

1. The first step of the sign-in process is to send a request to the `/authorize` endpoint on for our Azure Active Directory Tenant. Our MSAL4J `ConfidentialClientApplication` instance is leveraged to construct an authorization request URL. Our app redirects the browser to this URL, which is where the user will sign in.

    ```Java
    final ConfidentialClientApplication client = getConfidentialClientInstance();
    AuthorizationRequestUrlParameters parameters = AuthorizationRequestUrlParameters.builder(Config.REDIRECT_URI, Collections.singleton(Config.SCOPES))
            .responseMode(ResponseMode.QUERY).prompt(Prompt.SELECT_ACCOUNT).state(state).nonce(nonce).build();

    final String authorizeUrl = client.getAuthorizationRequestUrl(parameters).toString();
    contextAdapter.redirectUser(authorizeUrl);
    ```

    - **AuthorizationRequestUrlParameters**: Parameters that must be set in order to build an AuthorizationRequestUrl.
    - **REDIRECT_URI**: Where AAD will redirect the browser (along with auth code) after collecting user credentials. It must match the redirect URI in the  Azure AD app registration on [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
    - **SCOPES**: [Scopes](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens#scopes) are permissions requested by the application.
      - Normally, the three scopes `openid profile offline_access` suffice for receiving an ID Token response.
      - Full list of scopes requested by the app can be found in the [authentication.properties file](./src/main/resources/authentication.properties). You can add more scopes like User.Read and so on.

2. The user is presented with a sign-in prompt by Azure Active Directory. If the sign-in attempt is successful, the user's browser is redirected to our app's redirect endpoint. A valid request to this endpoint will contain an [**authorization code**](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow).
3. Our ConfidentialClientApplication instance then exchanges this authorization code for an ID Token and Access Token from Azure Active Directory.

    ```Java
    // First, validate the state, then parse any error codes in response, then extract the authCode. Then:
    // build the auth code params:
    final AuthorizationCodeParameters authParams = AuthorizationCodeParameters
            .builder(authCode, new URI(Config.REDIRECT_URI)).scopes(Collections.singleton(Config.SCOPES)).build();

    // Get a client instance and leverage it to acquire the token:
    final ConfidentialClientApplication client = AuthHelper.getConfidentialClientInstance();
    final IAuthenticationResult result = client.acquireToken(authParams).get();
    ```

    - **AuthorizationCodeParameters**: Parameters that must be set in order to exchange the Authorization Code for an ID and/or access token.
    - **authCode**: The authorization code that was received at the redirect endpoint.
    - **REDIRECT_URI**: The redirect URI used in the previous step must be passed again.
    - **SCOPES**: The scopes used in the previous step must be passed again.

4. If `acquireToken` is successful, the token claims are extracted. If the nonce check passes, the results are placed in `context` (an instance of `IdentityContextData`) and saved to the session. The application can then instantiate this from the session (by way of an instance of `IdentityContextAdapterServlet`) whenever it needs access to it:

    ```java
    // parse IdToken claims from the IAuthenticationResult:
    // (the next step - validateNonce - requires parsed claims)
    context.setIdTokenClaims(result.idToken());

    // if nonce is invalid, stop immediately! this could be a token replay!
    // if validation fails, throws exception and cancels auth:
    validateNonce(context);

    // set user to authenticated:
    context.setAuthResult(result, client.tokenCache().serialize());

    // handle groups overage if it has occurred.
    handleGroupsOverage(contextAdapter);
    ```

5. After previous step, group memberships may be extracted by calling `context.getGroups()` (an instance of `IdentityContextData`).
6. If the user is a member of too many groups (>200), a call to `context.getGroups()` might have been empty if it weren't for the call to `handleGroupsOverage()`. Meanwhile, `context.getGroupsOverage()` will return `true`, signalling that an overage has occurred, and that getting the full list of groups will require a call to Microsoft Graph. See `handleGroupsOverage()` method in `AuthHelper.java` for this application uses `context.setGroups()` when there is an overage.

### Protecting the routes

See `AuthenticationFilter.java` for how the sample app filters access to routes. In the `authentication.properties` file, the key `app.protect.authenticated` contains the comma-separated routes that are to be accessed by authenticated users only.

```ini
# e.g., /token_details requires any user to be signed in and does not require special groups claim
app.protect.authenticated=/token_details
```

Any of the routes listed in the comma-separated rule sets under the `app.protect.groups` are also off-limits to non-authenticated authenticated users.

However, these routes also contain a space-separated list of group memberships: only users belonging to at least one of the corresponding groups will be able to access these routes after authenticating.

```ini
# define short names for group IDs here for the app. This will be useful in the next key (app.protect.groups).
# EXCLUDE the curly braces, they are in this file only as delimiters.
# example:
# app.groups=groupA abcdef-qrstuvw-xyz groupB abcdef-qrstuv-wxyz
app.groups=admin {enter-your-admins-group-id-here}, user {enter-your-users-group-id-here}

# A route and its corresponding group(s) that can view it, <space-separated>; the start of the next route & its group(s) is delimited by a <comma-and-space-separator>
# this says: /admins_only can be accessed by admin group, /regular_user can be accessed by admin group and user group
app.protect.groups=/admin_only admin, /regular_user admin user
```

### Scopes

- [Scopes](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent) tell Azure AD the level of access that the application is requesting.
- Based on the requested scopes, Azure AD presents a consent dialogue to the user upon signing in.
- If the user consents to one or more scopes and obtains a token, the scopes-consented-to are encoded into the resulting `access_token`.
- Note the scope requested by the application by referring to [authentication.properties](./src/main/resources/authentication.properties). By default, the application sets the scopes value to `GroupMember.Read.All`.
- This particular MS Graph API scope is required in case the application needs to call Graph for getting the user's group memberships.
