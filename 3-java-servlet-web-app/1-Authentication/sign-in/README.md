## Overview

This sample demonstrates a Java Servlet web app that signs in users to your Azure Active Directory tenant using the [Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) for Java](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-java).

![Overview](./ReadmeFiles/topology.png)

## Scenario

1. This web application uses **MSAL for Java (MSAL4J)** to sign in users to their own Azure AD tenant and obtains an [ID Token](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/id-tokens) from **Azure AD**.
2. The **ID Token** proves that a user has successfully authenticated with this tenant.
3. The web application protects one of its routes according to user's authentication status.

## Prerequisites

- [JDK Version 8 or higher](https://jdk.java.net/8/)
- [Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- An Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. For more information on how to get an Azure AD tenant, see [How to get an Azure AD tenant](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-howto-tenant/)
- A user account in your own Azure AD tenant if you want to work with **accounts in your organizational directory only** (single-tenant mode). If have not yet [created a user account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/add-users-azure-active-directory) in your AD tenant yet, you should do so before proceeding.
- A user account in any organization's Azure AD tenant if you want to work with **accounts in any organizational directory** (multi-tenant mode).  This sample must be modified to work with a **personal Microsoft account**. If have not yet [created a user account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/add-users-azure-active-directory) in your AD tenant yet, you should do so before proceeding.
- A personal Microsoft account (e.g., Xbox, Hotmail, Live, etc) if you want to work with **personal Microsoft accounts**

## Setup

### Clone or download this repository

From your shell or command line:

```console
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-java-servlet-webapp-authentication.git
cd 1-Authentication/sign-in
```

or download and extract the repository .zip file.

> :warning: To avoid file path length limitations on Windows, clone the repository into a directory near the root of your hard drive.

## Register the sample application with your Azure Active Directory tenant

There is one project in this sample. To register the app on the portal, you can:

- either follow manual configuration steps below
- or use PowerShell scripts that:
  - **automatically** creates the Azure AD applications and related objects (passwords, permissions, dependencies) for you.
  - modify the projects' configuration files.
  - by default, the automation scripts set up an application that works with **accounts in your organizational directory only**.

<details>
  <summary>Expand this section if you want to use PowerShell automation.</summary>

1. On Windows, run PowerShell and navigate to the root of the cloned directory
1. In PowerShell run:

   ```PowerShell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process -Force
   ```

1. Run the script to create your Azure AD application and configure the code of the sample application accordingly.
1. In PowerShell run:

   ```PowerShell
   cd .\AppCreationScripts\
   .\Configure.ps1
   ```

   > Other ways of running the scripts are described in [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md)
   > The scripts also provide a guide to automated application registration, configuration and removal which can help in your CI/CD scenarios.

</details>

### Register the web app (java-servlet-webapp-authentication)

[Register a new web app](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app) in the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).
Following this guide, you must:

1. Navigate to the Microsoft identity platform for developers [App registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) page.
1. Select **New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application page** that appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `java-servlet-webapp-authentication`.
   - Under **Supported account types**, select an option.
     - Select **Accounts in this organizational directory only** if you're building an application for use only by users in your tenant (**single-tenant**).
     - Select **Accounts in any organizational directory** if you'd like users in any Azure AD tenant to be able to use your application (**multi-tenant**).
     - Select **Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts** for the widest set of customers (**multi-tenant** that also supports Microsoft personal accounts).
   - Select **Personal Microsoft accounts** for use only by users of personal Microsoft accounts (e.g., Hotmail, Live, Skype, Xbox accounts).
   - In the **Redirect URI** section, select **Web** in the combo-box and enter the following redirect URI: `http://localhost:8080/msal4j-servlet-auth/auth/redirect`.
1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. In the app's registration screen, find and note the **Application (client) ID**. You use this value in your app's configuration file(s) later in your code.
1. Select **Save** to save your changes.
1. In the app's registration screen, click on the **Certificates & secrets** blade in the left to open the page where we can generate secrets and upload certificates.
1. In the **Client secrets** section, click on **New client secret**:
   - Type a key description (for instance `app secret`),
   - Select one of the available key durations (**In 1 year**, **In 2 years**, or **Never Expires**) as per your security concerns.
   - The generated key value will be displayed when you click the **Add** button. Copy the generated value for use in the steps later.
   - You'll need this key later in your code's configuration files. This key value will not be displayed again, and is not retrievable by any other means, so make sure to note it from the Azure portal before navigating to any other screen or blade.

### Configure the web app (java-servlet-webapp-authentication) to use your app registration

Open the project in your IDE to configure the code.

> In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

1. Open the `./src/main/resources/authentication.properties` file
2. Find the string `{enter-your-tenant-id-here}`. Replace the existing value with:
    - **Your Azure AD tenant ID** if you registered your app with the **Accounts in this organizational directory only** option.
    - The word `organizations` if you registered your app with the **Accounts in any organizational directory** option.
    - The word `common` if you registered your app with the **Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts** option.
    - The word `consumers` if you registered your app with the **Personal Microsoft accounts** option
3. Find the string `{enter-your-client-id-here}` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of the `java-servlet-webapp-authentication` application copied from the Azure portal.
4. Find the string `{enter-your-client-secret-here}` and replace the existing value with the key you saved during the creation of the `java-servlet-webapp-authentication` app, in the Azure portal.

</details>

## Running The Sample
#### Build .war File Using Maven

1. Navigate to the directory containing the pom.xml file for this sample (the same directory as this README), and run the following Maven command:
    ```
    mvn clean package
    ```
1. This should generate a `.war` file which can be run on a variety of application servers

#### Deploying the Sample

Our samples can be deployed to a number of application servers, such as Tomcat, WebLogic, or Webshpere, and MSAL Java itself can generally be integrated into existing applications without changes to your existing deployment set up.

You can find instructions for deploying our samples [here on MSAL Java's Github wiki](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-java/wiki/Deployment-Instructions-for-MSAL-Java-Samples).

![Experience](./ReadmeFiles/app.png)

## Explore the sample

- Note the signed-in or signed-out status displayed at the center of the screen.
- Click the context-sensitive button at the top right (it will read `Sign In` on first run)
- Follow the instructions on the next page to sign in with an account in the Azure AD tenant.
- On the consent screen, note the scopes that are being requested.
- Note the context-sensitive button now says `Sign out` and displays your username to its left.
- The middle of the screen now has an option to click for **ID Token Details**: click it to see some of the ID token's decoded claims.
- You can also use the button on the top right to sign out.
- After signing out, click the link to `ID Token Details` to observe that the app displays a `401: unauthorized` error instead of the ID token claims when the user is not authorized.

## About the code

This sample shows how to use **MSAL for Java (MSAL4J)** to sign in users into your Azure AD tenant. If you'd like to use MSAL4J in your own applications, must add it to your projects using Maven.

If you want to replicate this sample's behavior, you may choose to copy the `pom.xml` file, and the contents of the `helpers` and `authservlets` packages in the `src/main/java/com/microsoft/azuresamples/msal4j` package. You'll also need the [authentication.properties file](src/main/resources/authentication.properties). These classes and files contain generic code that can be used in a wide array of applications. The rest of the sample may be copied as well, but the other classes and files are built specifically to address this sample's objective.

A **ConfidentialClientApplication** instance is created in the [AuthHelper.java](src/main/java/com/microsoft/azuresamples/authentication/AuthHelper.java) class. This object helps craft the AAD authorization URL and also helps exchange the authentication token for an access token.

```Java
// getConfidentialClientInstance method
IClientSecret secret = ClientCredentialFactory.createFromSecret(SECRET);
confClientInstance = ConfidentialClientApplication
                    .builder(CLIENT_ID, secret)
                    .authority(AUTHORITY)
                    .build();
```

The following parameters need to be provided upon instantiation:

- The **Client ID** of the app
- The **Client Secret**, which is a requirement for Confidential Client Applications
- The **Azure AD Authority**, which includes your AAD tenant ID.

In this sample, these values are read from the [authentication.properties](src/main/resources/authentication.properties) file using a properties reader in the class [Config.java](src/main/java/com/microsoft/azuresamples/authentication/Config.java).

### Step-by-step walkthrough

1. The first step of the sign-in process is to send a request to the `/authorize` endpoint on for our Azure Active Directory Tenant. Our MSAL4J `ConfidentialClientApplication` instance is leveraged to construct an authorization request URL. Our app redirects the browser to this URL, which is where the user will sign in.

    ```Java
    final ConfidentialClientApplication client = getConfidentialClientInstance();
    AuthorizationRequestUrlParameters parameters = AuthorizationRequestUrlParameters.builder(Config.REDIRECT_URI, Collections.singleton(Config.SCOPES))
            .responseMode(ResponseMode.QUERY).prompt(Prompt.SELECT_ACCOUNT).state(state).nonce(nonce).build();

    final String authorizeUrl = client.getAuthorizationRequestUrl(parameters).toString();
    contextAdapter.redirectUser(authorizeUrl);
    ```

    - **AuthorizationRequestUrlParameters**: Parameters that must be set in order to build an AuthorizationRequestUrl.
    - **REDIRECT_URI**: Where AAD will redirect the browser (along with auth code) after collecting user credentials. It must match the redirect URI in the  Azure AD app registration on [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
    - **SCOPES**: [Scopes](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens#scopes) are permissions requested by the application.
      - Normally, the three scopes `openid profile offline_access` suffice for receiving an ID Token response.
      - Full list of scopes requested by the app can be found in the [authentication.properties file](./src/main/resources/authentication.properties). You can add more scopes like User.Read and so on.

2. The user is presented with a sign-in prompt by Azure Active Directory. If the sign-in attempt is successful, the user's browser is redirected to our app's redirect endpoint. A valid request to this endpoint will contain an [**authorization code**](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow).
3. Our ConfidentialClientApplication instance then exchanges this authorization code for an ID Token and Access Token from Azure Active Directory.

    ```Java
    // First, validate the state, then parse any error codes in response, then extract the authCode. Then:
    // build the auth code params:
    final AuthorizationCodeParameters authParams = AuthorizationCodeParameters
            .builder(authCode, new URI(Config.REDIRECT_URI)).scopes(Collections.singleton(Config.SCOPES)).build();

    // Get a client instance and leverage it to acquire the token:
    final ConfidentialClientApplication client = AuthHelper.getConfidentialClientInstance();
    final IAuthenticationResult result = client.acquireToken(authParams).get();
    ```

    - **AuthorizationCodeParameters**: Parameters that must be set in order to exchange the Authorization Code for an ID and/or access token.
    - **authCode**: The authorization code that was received at the redirect endpoint.
    - **REDIRECT_URI**: The redirect URI used in the previous step must be passed again.
    - **SCOPES**: The scopes used in the previous step must be passed again.

4. If `acquireToken` is successful, the token claims are extracted. If the nonce check passes, the results are placed in `context` (an instance of `IdentityContextData`) and saved to the session. The application can then instantiate this from the session (by way of an instance of `IdentityContextAdapterServlet`) whenever it needs access to it:

    ```java
    // parse IdToken claims from the IAuthenticationResult:
    // (the next step - validateNonce - requires parsed claims)
    context.setIdTokenClaims(result.idToken());

    // if nonce is invalid, stop immediately! this could be a token replay!
    // if validation fails, throws exception and cancels auth:
    validateNonce(context);

    // set user to authenticated:
    context.setAuthResult(result, client.tokenCache().serialize());
    ```

### Protecting the routes

See `AuthenticationFilter.java` for how the sample app filters access to routes. In the `authentication.properties` file, the key `app.protect.authenticated` contains the comma-separated routes that are to be accessed by authenticated users only.

```ini
# e.g., /token_details requires any user to be signed in and does not require special roles claim(s)
app.protect.authenticated=/token_details
```

### Scopes

- [Scopes](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent) tell Azure AD the level of access that the application is requesting.
- Based on the requested scopes, Azure AD presents a consent dialogue to the user upon signing in.
- If the user consents to one or more scopes and obtains a token, the scopes-consented-to are encoded into the resulting `access_token`.
- Note the scopes requested by the application by referring to [authentication.properties](./src/main/resources/authentication.properties). These three scopes are requested by MSAL and given by Azure Active Directory by default.

## Next Steps or Deploy to Azure

As next steps, we can now either [get an Access Token for the users we signed-in in this tutorial](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-java-servlet-webapp-call-graph), or we can proceed [to deploy this app to the **Azure App Service**](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-java-servlet-webapp-authentication/tree/main/4-Deployment/deploy-to-azure-app-service).
